These files are intended to be a simple example in how to 
incorporate multiple modules within GridLAB-D.

This sample incorporates a stub auction market system 
(a non-bidding market that simply uses a data stream to 
create a pre-defined market system) and a transactive 
controller to adjust the heating and cooling setpoints as 
a function of price.  Additionally, all of these systems 
are running on top of a very simple distribution system
(an overhead line, three center-tap transformers,
triplex lines, and meters).

Two files exist, and should be used by comparing the outputs
of the two files.  The first, Run_Electric_Fixed, uses 
triplex meters to monitor the energy usage of each of 99 
homes, and translates that into a standard tiered utitlity
bill.  The second, Run_Electric_RTP, uses the same 99 homes,
but operates them with a transactive controller using a real
time pricing signal from the stub auction object to reduce
load at times of high prices.

By comparing energy consumption between the two runs, 
especially during times of high or low prices relative to the
previous twenty-four hours, the effects of the transactive
controller can be seen.
